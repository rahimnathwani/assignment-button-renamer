# Note: the main feature of this extension (button renaming) and more (PDF preview) is now included in a better extension that Ansh Sikka made and published: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-pre-submission-pre/micpkocdgpegjoejbjbkfagipgmbonkc
I'll leave this repo up for posterity.

# Assignment Button Renamer for Gatech OMSCS

## Introduction

This Chrome extension is designed to assist Gatech OMSCS (Online Master of Science in Computer Science) students. The primary goal is to reduce the likelihood of submitting assignments to the wrong page.

## Problem Statement

## Solution
